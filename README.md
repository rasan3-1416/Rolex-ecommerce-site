### Responsive Watches Website ⌚

The project I clone from [Bedimcode](https://www.youtube.com/c/Bedimcode) and website template: [Responsive Tasty Food](https://youtu.be/QPxYdbbCjhQ?si=nneIT4t5Xrfch9tb)

Note: The actual project was built with raw CSS code while I used the [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) framework to build the site
